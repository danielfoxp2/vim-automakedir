INTRODUCTION

This plugin is intended to those moments in vim where you are editing
a file that belongs to a path not created yet.

USAGE

Just install the plugin and when you open a file using vim and the file has some dir not created
the plugin will ask you what to do.

Example in bash:
```bash
vim ./this/part/of/the/path/does/not/exist/file.txt
```
This will create the dirs: this, part, of, the, path, does, not and exist

The same happens when you try to open a file using :e of vim.
